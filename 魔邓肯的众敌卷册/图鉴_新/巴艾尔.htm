<P>With the Blood War raging for eons and no end in sight, 
opportunities abound for ambitious archdevils to win fame, glory, and power in 
the ongoing struggle against the demons. Duke Bael, one of Mammon's most 
important vassals, has won fame and acclaim for his victories. Charged with 
leading sixty-six companies of barbed devils, Bael has proven to be a tactical 
genius, earning esteem for himself and his master as a result of victory after 
victory over the abyssal host. Mammon relies on Bael, because of his battle 
acumen, to safeguard his holdings. Mammon has never been ousted during a time 
when so many other archdevils have lost their positions, which is a testament to 
Bael's skill on the battlefield.<BR>For his accomplishments, as well as for the 
hue of his skin, Baal has been granted the title of Bronze General. His 
accolades notwithstanding, Bael has had a difficult time navigating the quagmire 
of infernal politics. His critics call him naive, though never to his face. His 
primary interest has always been leading soldiers in battle, so he finds it 
frustrating to have his ambitions of ascending to a higher rank constantly 
stymied by politically shrewd rivals.</P>
<P>Bael prefers to make servants out of his adversaries, 
and mortals bound to his service earn their wretched place by falling victim to 
Bael's superior stratagems. Bael gladly spares the lives of those he defeats, 
but only if they pledge their souls and service to him. Although he is willing 
to corrupt almost any being in this way, he always destroys any demons he 
defeats.</P>
<P>Bael also welcomes mortals into his service if they can 
provide him with an advantage in his own politicking. He recruits savvy 
individuals and relies on them to represent his interests at Mammon's court, 
which leaves Bael free to pursue his battle lust.</P>
<P>Despite his lack of interest in affairs outside battle, 
or perhaps because of it, Bael has gained a small following of cultists. Those 
who worship at his altar call him the King of Hell, and the most deluded believe 
that he is the lord of all devils. In arcane circles, certain writings, such as 
the dreaded Book of Fire, say that Bael revealed the invisibility spell to the 
world, though some scholars of magic hotly refute such claims. Bael is sometimes 
depicted as a toad, a cat, a male human, or some combination of these forms, 
though none of these images reflect his true appearance.</P>
