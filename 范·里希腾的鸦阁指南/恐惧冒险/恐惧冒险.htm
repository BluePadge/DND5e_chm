<P>Creating your own horror adventures is like crafting any 
other D&amp;D adventure with one exception: your goal is to horrify your players 
in the most fun way possible. Frightening adventures benefit from an atmosphere 
of dread, conceived through a combination of terrifying narratives, dramatic 
presentation, and game elements encouraging fear. Drawing out the anxiety and 
anticipation of players requires deliberate consideration, though. The tools and 
techniques in this chapter provide ways to make sure your game is both spooky 
and safe in ways right for your specific group. A toolbox of horror-focused 
rules also provides options for what sort of grim adventures you might create. 
At the end of this chapter, a horror adventure puts these methods to use and 
leads characters on their first steps into the Domains of 
Dread.</P></body>
