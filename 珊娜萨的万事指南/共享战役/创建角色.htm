<P>A shared campaign's guidelines for character creation 
might include definition of which races and classes players can choose from, how 
players generate ability scores, and which alignments players can choose.</P>
<P>Player's Handbook plus One<BR>You should think about 
which products players can use to create a character. The Adventurers League 
specifies that a player can use the player's handbook and one other official 
D&amp;D source, such as a book or a PDF, to create a character. This restriction 
ensures that players don't need to own a lot of books to make a character and 
makes it easier for DMs to know how all the characters in the campaign work. 
Since a DM in a shared campaign must deal with a broad range of characters, 
rather than the same characters each week, it can be difficult to track all the 
interactions and abilities possible through mixing options freely. We strongly 
recommend this rule for any shared campaign.</P>
<P>Ability Scores<BR>For generating ability scores, we 
recommend allowing players to choose between the standard array-15, 14, 13, 12, 
10, 8-and the option presented in "Variant: Customizing Ability Scores" in 
chapter 1 of the player's handbook.</P>
<P>Starting Equipment<BR>For the sake of simplicity and 
efficiency, it's a good idea to require that beginning characters must take the 
starting equipment specified by a character's class and 
background.</P></body>
