<P>（翻译暂缺）</P>
<P>Every adventurer needs a pick-me-up now and again, and 
nothing slakes the thirst and dulls an ache quite like a Potion of Restoration. 
Fruity and sweet, with tones of blackberry and lemon, the gin hides away until 
you already feel its fire in your belly. Barkeeps imbue it with a pinch of 
butterfly pea, which gives it a distinctive blue color―in a dimly lit dungeon, 
you might even mistake it for its magical namesake. But then again, if you drink enough of these, you will know neither 
pain nor fear...though you may not be undertaking any glorious feats either.</P>

            Crème de mure is a 
blackberry liqueur. If you can't find it, crème de cassis, a black currant liqueur, is 
a fine substitute.</P>
<P>In a cocktail shaker, muddle together 11 of the blackberries, the sugar, and 
lemon juice until the sugar dissolves fully. Add the gin and butterfly pea 
powder (if using). Fill the shaker about halfway with ice. Cover and shake to 
blend and chill, 30 seconds. Fill two chilled old-fashion or rocks glasses about 
halfway with ice and strain half the mixture into each, then pour 1/2 ounce 
crème de mure over the ice in each. Run one lemon twist around the rim of each 
glass and drop it in; add two of the remaining blackberries to each glass and 
serve at once.</P>    <div

       <P>The drinks have a purple hue from the muddled 
blackberries, but to make the color extra vibrant, use the butterfly pea powder, 
which creates a vivid magenta color in the presence of an acid, such as lemon 
juice. Butterfly pea powder is available online and at some natural foods stores 
with a good selection of herbs and spices.</P></div>
